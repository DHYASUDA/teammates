Our team’s mission is to contribute meaningful, maintainable improvements to the TEAMMATES open-source project while practicing real-world collaborative development workflows.

We aim to make small, focused contributions that improve usability, reliability, or code clarity, while respecting the project’s existing architecture, coding standards, and community guidelines.

Through this project, we prioritize clear communication, shared responsibility, and learning from real open-source development practices rather than producing large or risky changes.
