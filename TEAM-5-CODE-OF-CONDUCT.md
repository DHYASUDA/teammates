Our team commits to maintaining a respectful, collaborative, and professional working environment throughout this project.

We will communicate clearly and honestly about progress and challenges, respect differing technical approaches, and review each other’s contributions constructively.

All contributions will aim to follow the TEAMMATES project’s coding standards and open-source best practices.

We value learning, accountability, and cooperation over individual ownership of code.
